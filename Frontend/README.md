# CPSC 559 Final Project (Distributed Systems)

## Running Frontend
1. Install node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
> [!NOTE]
> With windows, there will be an option to install Chocolately, make sure to install that. Example of an installation can be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIzdQxMXcrc (just watch the first 4 mins)

2. Check if node is installed using the terminal
```
node --version
```
3. Open the frontend folder in your IDE (I would recommend using VS code)
4. Using the VS code terminal change the current directory to the client folder

5. Run npm install in the terminal and wait for the packages to download
```
npm install
```
> [!NOTE]
> This only needs to be done once, you don't have to run this every time

6. Start the web app
```
npm run start
```

From here a page should open in your browser and a react loading screen will appear
